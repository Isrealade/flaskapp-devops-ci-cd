# üöÄ Flask Dockerized Application with CI/CD

This is a simple Flask web application designed as part of a DevOps learning project. It demonstrates how to build, containerize, and automate deployment of a basic Python web app using Git, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project was created for **DevOps Project 1** on a [YAML Ops Slack Community](https://yamlopscommunity.slack.com) and follows a real-world DevOps workflow from code to deployment. The app includes:

- A basic Flask server with a Home, About, and Contact routes
- Docker containerization for consistent builds
- GitHub Actions pipeline for automated CI/CD
- Option to push Docker images to Docker Hub
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask**
- **Docker**
- **Git + GitHub**
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**

## üí° DevOps Implementation

### üîß 1. Flask Application
- A minimal Flask app (`app.py`) with a simple route.
- Customizable for more routes and templates if needed.

### üì¶ 2. Dockerized Environment
- `Dockerfile` to containerize the application
- `.dockerignore` to optimize image build
- Local development and testing via Docker

### üìÇ 3. Version Control with Git & GitHub
- Project initialized with Git
- `.gitignore` for Python/Docker exclusions
- Hosted on GitHub for collaboration and automation

### üîÅ 4. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Actions** workflow file under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Workflow automatically triggered on:
  - Pushes to the `main` branch
  - Pull requests
  - Manual workflow dispatch
- Workflow steps include:
  - Running Python tests using `pytest` to ensure code quality
  - Building the Docker image
  - Pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub tagged with the commit SHA

> You can find and customize the GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### üîê Environment Variables & Secrets

To enable Docker image pushing in the CI/CD workflow, you need to set the following in your GitHub repository settings:

- **`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`** (set as a repository variable)
- **`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`** (set as a secret containing your Docker Hub access token)

Without these, the workflow cannot authenticate to Docker Hub and push images.
